# Coffee Quality Testing

## Project Overview
This project focused on analyzing the quality of coffee using statistical techniques and data visualization. We explored various factors that could potentially influence the coffee quality and investigated the relationship between these factors and the overall quality score of the coffee samples.

## Project Steps
### Data Preparation and Exploration:

It includes reading and cleaning the coffee dataset and selecting only the relevant columns for analysis.
We visualized the distribution of Arabica coffee quality using a histogram.
Summary statistics were calculated to gain insights into the data.
### Variable Analysis:

To examine their distributions, we plotted various variables, including aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, sweetness, body, balance, and cupper points.
Correlation analysis was performed to identify the variables most strongly associated with coffee quality.
Scatter plots were created to visualize the relationships between coffee quality and the most correlated variables (balance, aftertaste, and flavor).
### Hypothesis Testing:

We conducted hypothesis tests to determine the relationships between the number of bags, sweetness, moisture, and coffee quality.
Chi-square tests were performed, and p-values were evaluated to accept or reject the null hypotheses.
## Coffee Quality and Country of Origin:

We analyzed the quality of coffee produced in Colombia and Mexico, two major coffee-producing countries.
Density plots and empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) were used to compare the quality distributions.
A hypothesis test was conducted to determine if the quality of coffee differed significantly between Colombia and Mexico.
## Key Findings
- Variables such as balance, aftertaste, and flavor were strongly correlated with coffee quality, with balance showing a moderate linear relationship.
- Sweetness, number of bags, and moisture had weaker correlations with coffee quality.
- The quality of coffee produced in Colombia was generally higher than that of coffee produced in Mexico.
## Conclusion
The coffee quality analysis showed that factors like balance, aftertaste, and flavor played significant roles in determining coffee quality. The team's findings highlighted the importance of considering these factors when assessing coffee quality. Furthermore, we discovered that the moisture and sweetness of the coffee had less impact on its overall quality. Additionally, the analysis revealed that coffee produced in Colombia generally exhibited higher quality compared to coffee from Mexico.
